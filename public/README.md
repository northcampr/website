# Public Assets

The files in this directory are public assets, which are not processed by Vite. It is used for static files such as images, fonts, and robots.txt.

The files placed in this directory will be available directly on served domain, for example, [robots.txt](./robots.txt) will be available at `example.com/robots.txt` &mdash; assuming we're serving the site on `example.com`.
