# Privacy Policy

All of your personal and/or sensitive information is safe, as I do not collect it. No cookies, no analytics, no advertisements, no visitor logs, own servers, and high security standards.

## No Cookies
> I do not build profiles of my visitors and do not track them on other websites, I just build websites that work well. This website functions well without cookies, so they are not necessary.
## No Analytics
> I do not use general analytics, because I develop my website with a focus on content and do not attach value to collecting statistics about my visitors.
## No Advertisements
> I do not have advertisements on my website, because I believe that advertisements disrupt the user experience and dilute the content of my website.
## No Visitor Logs
> I do not have visitor logs. I only store logs with error messages, such as pages not found or missing files. These logs do not contain IP addresses, and are only held in memory rather than on disk. They are automatically deleted after 7 days.
## Static Site Generator
> I use a static site generator, which makes the website load quickly and does not require a server to generate the content each time. This also means that there is no need for a database, which improves security.
## Open Source Code
> By publishing the code of my website, I allow everyone to inspect, verify, and improve the code. The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ricardobalk/website).
## Secure Servers
> I have my own servers, which I manage myself and have full control over. The server is located in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, a country that is not subject to EU/US legislation and also has very strict privacy laws. I have an **<span style="color: #00cc00;">A+</span>** on the websites of [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=ricardobalk.nl) and [SecurityHeaders.io](https://securityheaders.com/?q=ricardobalk.nl&followRedirects=on).

## Tor is Supported
> You can always visit my website [via Tor](http://nciwf3vh63efdjqymcpq2uey2ahufyskyzeon4zomd6vg4lpdg5vfiyd.onion/). By using Tor, you remain anonymous and it is completely impossible for me to identify you.
