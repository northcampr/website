  text:
    - I am a firm believer in the power of user-centered design and I always strive to create a pleasant user experience. In order to achieve this, I spend a lot of time researching and understanding my users and their needs. I believe that by focusing on the user and their needs, we can create products that are both functional and visually appealing, that will ultimately lead to a better user experience.
    - When it comes to development, I follow the principles of Atomic Design. This methodology helps me to create consistent, modular and reusable components that can be easily assembled into larger, more complex interfaces. Additionally, I am a strong advocate of the mobile-first approach. I believe that mobile devices are now the primary way that people access the web and that a good mobile experience is the foundation of a good web experience.

<h1>About me&hellip;</h1>

<p>
  I'm Ricardo - a web developer who is passionate about technology, creating beautiful user interfaces and writing clean and reusable code. I love working on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what is possible and require me to think creatively and outside the box.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently working as a full stack developer with a strong focus on design and user experience. My preferred stack is a combination of Vue and Go, powerful frameworks that allows me to create fast, elegant and responsive web applications.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time, I like to give back to the community by contributing to open-source projects. I believe that open-source software is a powerful tool for driving innovation and progress, and I want to be a part of that.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not glued to my screen, I love reading a good book or going for a hike.
