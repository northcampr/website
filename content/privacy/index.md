# Privacy Policy

All of your personal and/or sensitive information is safe, as I do not collect it. No cookies, no analytics, no advertisements, no visitor logs, own servers, and high security standards.

## No Cookies
> I do not build profiles of my visitors and do not track them on other websites, I just build websites that work well. This website functions well without cookies, so they are not necessary.
## No Analytics
> I do not use general analytics, because I develop my website with a focus on content and do not attach value to collecting statistics about my visitors.
## No Advertisements
> I do not have advertisements on my website, because I believe that advertisements disrupt the user experience and dilute the content of my website.
## Static Site Generator
> I use a static site generator, which makes the website load quickly and does not require a server to generate the content each time. This also means that there is no need for a database, which improves security.
## Open Source Code
> By publishing the code of my website, I allow everyone to inspect, verify, and improve the code. The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ricardobalk/website).
