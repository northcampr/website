# Home

Hello world. This is a test for the home page. Everything is unstyled, but it's a start. Take a look at the HTML and the Markdown source code to see how it works.

If you're looking for something styled, take a look at [this blog article](/blog/article).
## Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

This is a paragraph, and here is some **bold** text. Here is some *italic* text. Here is some `inline code` text. Here is a [link](https://www.example.com). Here is a [link with a title](https://www.example.com "Example"). And also, below is a blockquote with Lorem Ipsum:

> :MoleculeLoremIpsum{:count=1}

It shows the ability to import a so-called Molecule component from the `molecules` directory, and use it in the content. The molecule component is a simple Vue component that renders one or more paragraphs with some Lorem Ipsum text.

In MDC, it is defined using `:MoleculeLoremIpsum{:count=1}`.

Molecules will be used to create more complex components, called Organisms, Templates and Pages, such as a blog post, a page, a product, etc.

I'm still figuring out how to use these components in the content, but I think it's in the right direction.
