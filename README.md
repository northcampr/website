**What is this?**

This repository contains [my personal website][]. It's made with VuePress 2 (based on Vue 3), some code, a lot of coffee and loads of love.

- VuePress provides a way to run a blog with Markdown files.
- A modern Flexbox-approach is used for creating a 12 column grid layout.
- Docker packs up everything and ensures that everything works as expected, on any computer.

**Driven by JAMstack, and proud of it!**

My website is basically a JAMstack website. JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs and Markup) is not something you would install, but an approach for having a simpler developer experience, higher performance, lower cost and greater scalability.

**The entire website is open source!**

My entire website is open source. This means that anyone could download the source code, inspect it, play around with it, help me in improving the website or run their own version of it. Don't forget to star this repository on GitHub if you like it. :+1:
